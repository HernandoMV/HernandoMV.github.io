excerpt: 'Animals choice behavior is characterized by two main tendencies: taking actions that led to rewards and repeating past actions. Theory suggests these strategies may be reinforced by different types of dopaminergic teaching signals: reward prediction error (RPE) to reinforce value-based associations and movement-based action prediction errors to reinforce value-free repetitive associations. Here we use an auditory-discrimination task in mice to show that movement-related dopamine activity in the tail of the striatum encodes the hypothesized action prediction error signal. Causal manipulations reveal that this prediction error serves as a value-free teaching signal that supports learning by reinforcing repeated associations. Computational modeling and experiments demonstrate that action prediction errors cannot support reward-guided learning but when paired with the RPE circuity they serve to consolidate stable sound-action associations in a value-free manner. Together we show that there are two types of dopaminergic prediction errors that work in tandem to support learning.'
