title: "The conserved core of the nereid brain: Circular CNS, apical nervous system and lhx6-arx-dlx neurons"

excerpt: 'When bilaterian animals first emerged, an enhanced perception of the Precambrian environment was key to their stunning success. This occurred through the acquisition of an anterior brain, as found in most extant bilaterians. What were the core circuits of the first brain, and how do they relate to today&apos;s diversity? With two landmark resources – the full connectome and a multimodal cellular atlas combining gene expression and ultrastructure – the young worm of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii takes center stage in comparative bilaterian neuroanatomy. The new data suggest a composite structure of the ancestral bilaterian brain, with the anterior end of a circular CNS fused to a sensory-neurosecretory apical system, and with lhx6-arx-dlx chemosensory circuits giving rise to associative centers in the descending bilaterian lineages.'

When bilaterian animals first emerged, an enhanced perception of the Precambrian environment was key to their stunning success. This occurred through the acquisition of an anterior brain, as found in most extant bilaterians. What were the core circuits of the first brain, and how do they relate to today&apos;s diversity? With two landmark resources – the full connectome and a multimodal cellular atlas combining gene expression and ultrastructure – the young worm of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii takes center stage in comparative bilaterian neuroanatomy.
