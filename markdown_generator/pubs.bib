	abstract = {Facing the challenge of exploring and sharing multi-terabyte, multi-modal and multi-scale image data of heterogeneous dimensionality, we developed MoBIE, a Fiji plugin that provides rich visualization features to enable browsing data from numerous biomedical applications on a standard laptop computer. MoBIE also supports segmentations, associated measurements and annotations. Users can configure complex views of datasets, share them with collaborators, and use them for interactive figure panels. The MoBIE plugin also offers a convenient interface for converting data into compatible data formats; an additional Python library facilitates managing diverse MoBIE projects.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
