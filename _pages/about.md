I am a multidisciplinary biology researcher with 13 years of experience working in vitro and in vivo, and I have strong skills in software development and analysis of multimodal data. I can identify problems and formulate them in testable frameworks, and I have the ability to solve them creatively, developing and applying state-of-the-art methods, and teaming up with scientists of diverse disciplines. I understand, analyse, distil and disseminate complex information efficiently, I have strong attention to detail, and I learn new skills quickly.
