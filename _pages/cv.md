Education
======
* PhD in Natural Sciences, Heidelberg University, 2016
* MSc in Cell and Developmental Biology, San Francisco State University, 2012
* MSc in Bioinformatics, King's College London, 2010
* BSc in Biotechnology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 2009

Professional experience
======
* **Senior Research Fellow**, Sainsbury Wellcome Center, UCL, 2018 - currently employed
    * Led research on the neural basis of learning in mice resulting in one high-impact publication in a time-efficient manner for the standards of the field.
    * Designed experiments and supervised the scientific work of four researchers.
    * Implemented and automated over ten statistical workflows for the analysis of complex datasets involving machine learning toolkits (e.g. scikit-learn) in Python.
    * Designed two histological quantification and visualization software packages for the analysis of biomarkers in Python and Java, increasing throughput twenty-fold.
    * Accomplished over a hundred complex brain surgeries in mice successfully.
    * Worked extensively with AAVs to label and manipulate neurons specifically.
    * Performed over fifty in vivo experiments involving behavioral training of rodents, electrophysiological recordings, optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations, histological processing, and imaging using confocal and two-photon microscopy.
    * Completed three international courses for leadership and laboratory management.
    * Prepared over twenty presentations and posters for international meetings.
    * Organized scientific dissemination events and participated in public outreach.
    * Secured personal funding (>70K GBP) by achieving a highly competitive grant.
    * Led the implementation of several policies at the institutional level.

* **Postdoctoral and Graduate Researcher**, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, 2012 - 2017
    * Led research on the evolution of the nervous system using molecular and imaging techniques, resulting in seven scientific articles in high-impact journals.
    * Designed and implemented a high-throughput transcriptomics method, and developed the current state-of-the-art software to automatically analyze the data to generate spatial transcriptome atlases using image analysis in ImageJ and R.
    * Managed an international collaboration project involving multidisciplinary research groups, dealing with single-cell and spatial omics, resulting in a breakthrough publication in the journal Cell.
    * Completed ten courses on machine learning, artificial intelligence, mathematical modeling, software development, and biomedical entrepreneurship.
    * Collaborated in a project to spatially map single-cell sequencing data.
    * Performed multiple experiments involving plasmid design and cloning, Crispr-Cas9 gene editing, sequencing and phylogenetics, DNA and RNA purification, blotting, cell culture, microinjection, histology, and confocal and electron microscopy.
    * Teached four introductory courses on image analysis.

* **Additional experience**, KCL, SFSU, 2009 - 2012
    * Led research in muscle development using gene expression interference.
    * Secured personal funding (>120K USD) by achieving a highly competitive grant.
    * Performed bioinformatics analysis of genetic interaccions using graph theory.
