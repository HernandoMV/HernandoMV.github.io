* **Senior Research Fellow**, Sainsbury Wellcome Center, UCL, 2018 - 2023
  * Led research on the neural basis of learning in mice resulting in one high-impact publication
    in a time-efficient manner for the standards of the field.
  * Supervised the scientific work of four researchers.
  * Implemented and automated over ten statistical workflows for the analysis of complex time-series
    datasets involving machine learning toolkits (e.g. scikit-learn) in Python.
  * Designed two histological quantification and visualization software packages for the high-throughput
    analysis of biomarkers in Python and Java, increasing efficiency twenty-fold.
  * Designed and performed over fifty in vivo experiments involving behavioral training of rodents,
    electrophysiological recordings of neurons, optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations or neuronal
    activity, and anatomical tracing of neuronal processes.
  * Processed hundreds of histological samples, optimised protocols to label RNA and protein biomarkers,
    and imaged animal tissue samples using confocal and two-photon microscopy.
  * Accomplished over a hundred complex stereotactical brain surgeries in mice successfully.
  * Worked extensively with AAVs and other viruses to label and manipulate neurons specifically.
  * Engineered and designed hardware components for the control of experimental variables in
    close loop, involving electronics and robotics, and programming in Matlab and Python.
  * Completed three international courses for leadership and laboratory management.
  * Prepared and delivered over twenty scientific presentations and presented two posters
    in international meetings.
  * Organized scientific dissemination events and participated in public outreach.
  * Secured personal funding (>70K GBP) by achieving a highly competitive international grant.
  * Led the implementation of several policies at the institutional level.
  * Trained multiple researchers in experimental competencies for handling and working with animals.
  * Teached two courses on behavioural experiments.
  
* **Postdoctoral and Graduate Researcher**, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, 2012 - 2017
  * Led research on the evolution of the nervous system,
    resulting in seven scientific articles in high-impact journals.
  * Designed and implemented a high-throughput transcriptomics method, and developed the current
    state-of-the-art software to automatically analyze gene expression data to generate spatial transcriptome
    atlases using image analysis in ImageJ and R.
  * Managed an international collaboration project involving multidisciplinary research groups,
    dealing with single-cell and spatial omics, resulting in a breakthrough publication in the journal Cell.
  * Completed ten courses on machine learning, artificial intelligence, mathematical modeling,
    software development, and biomedical entrepreneurship.
  * Performed multiple experiments involving plasmid design and cloning, Crispr-Cas9 gene editing,
    sequencing and phylogenetics, DNA and RNA purification, blotting, cell culture, microinjection,
    histology and staining, and imaging using confocal and electron microscopy.
  * Collaborated in a project to spatially map single-cell sequencing data.
  * Designed a software for motion tracking on freely moving animals in Matlab.
  * Teached four introductory courses on image analysis.
  * Prepared and delivered multiple scientific reports and oral presentations for effective dissemination
    of scientific data.
  * Supervised the scientific work of two researchers.

* **Additional experience**, KCL, SFSU, 2009 - 2012
  * Led research in muscle development using gene expression interference.
  * Secured personal funding (>120K USD) by achieving a highly competitive grant.
  * Performed bioinformatics analysis of genetic interaccions using graph theory.
